### **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

User needs are the reason for working on anything that needs to sell. Finding those needs and building a way to produce what is required is essential. I need to break down the goals of the user into bite sized peices that can be transformed into code. User stories are a great way to break down a customer's needs into bite sized chunks of work that can be completed in short periods of time to create continous progression toward the final goal. Making these gives me a clear view of what needs to be done in order to complete each part of the project.

### **How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

If I am working on a project, I think Kanban boards are a great way to keep track of ideas and tasks. Breaking it down into sections of progress, if you will, helps with a visual representation of progress and what steps need to be taken next. This can be combined with a sort of backlog through the Kanban boards. I can clean up the to do list portion and change things out as needed when the goals change. I tend to think through the general idea of the project and then make a move. 

### **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Good communication has to be the definition of a good team member in software development in my eyes. Being able to work effectively starts with language. Being able to present your information, needs and whatever else it may be is important for the team to be able to work as a cohesive unit. The work can still be done with bad communication technically, but it will be nowhere near as effecient nor the quality level that should be achievable.
